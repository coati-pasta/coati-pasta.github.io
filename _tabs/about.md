I'm a System Engineer working on automation of services. The reason for me to start this blog was to share and give back to the community. During my endavours in building systems and services I found a lot of good information and guides on the internet. Most of the time I'd find the answer to what I need to do clear and simple.

However, sometimes this was not the case and then the creative engineering begins, where I would put together bits and pieces I found on the internet  to make it work. Thatâ€™s what I wanted to share, give back what I disover and put together. I'll always try and cite the sources where I remember.
